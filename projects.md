Here are some of the projects we are working on.

1. Early Wildfire Detection
     - Build/train wildfire detectors
     - Improve existing production detectors
     - Train nite time wildfire detectors
     - Build depth estimation model from single monocular image to determine the lat/long of detected wildfire
     - Build GAN to generate synthetic smoke images
     - Deploy prod detectors to run on edge devices

2. Scene Understanding to enable people who are blind to navigate the world freely
    -  Build wearable camera with navigation cues to guide people who are blind
