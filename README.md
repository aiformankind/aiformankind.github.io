# AI For Mankind

AI For Mankind is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with the mission of mobilizing the tech community to work on world challenging problems using AI and Data. We organize tech talks, workshops, and hackathons. We want to build a grassroot community of volunteers creating solutions using AI and Data to bring positive impacts to society at large. 

Together we can make things happen !

AI For Mankind was founded by [Wei Shung Chung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-shung-chung-01326a7/) as a [meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/AI-for-Mankind/) in April 2018. It was registered as a nonprofit organization in May 2019.

## Learning Materials
- [Wildfire Smoke Detection Colab Notebook](https://github.com/aiformankind/lets-stop-wildfires-hackathon/blob/master/Challenge_1B_WildfireSmokeImageClassifierForDemo.ipynb). We built this wildfire smoke classification notebook as a quickstart notebook for our [Lets Stop Wildfires Hackathon](https://aiformankind.org/lets-stop-wildfires-hackathon/). However you can adapt it easily to classify other types of images.
- [Covid-19 Data Exploratory Notebooks](data_exploratory_notebooks.md) contributed by our volunteers and participants of our hackathons.

## Our Projects
- **Seeing the World Project** to build a more accessible and navigable physical world for people who are blind or have low vision.

- **Wildfires Smoke Detection Project** to investigate and promote the use of AI Deep Learning in early wildfire smoke detection. We want to raise awareness about the crisis and rally more people/AI experts to work on this problem. We continue to promote the curation of open datasets to speed up research and development. We collaborate with [HPWREN](http://hpwren.ucsd.edu/) in promoting the collaboration of our volunteers from private tech with public sector in solving this wildfire crisis.

  [2019 Lets Stop Wildfires Hackathon](https://aiformankind.github.io/lets-stop-wildfires-hackathon/)
  
- **Healthcare: Combat Covid-19 Pandemic Project** We organize series of online hackathons to work on ideas and build useful applications to help everyone in combating Covid-19. [See contributions by our participants](https://aiformankind.org/covid-19-hackathon/#exploratory-data-analysis-notebooks-built-by-hackathon-participants).

Once again, thank you to all our volunteers for their dedication and contribution.
